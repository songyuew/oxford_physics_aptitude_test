Revision note for Oxford Physics Aptitude Test

## Introduction
I wrote the formula sheet and derivation of formula according to all PAT papers from 2006 to 2019, sample papers published by Oxford and CAIE A-Level Physics syllabus.
Hopefully these could help your preparation for PAT exam and admission interview.

## Advice
 * Try to learn Grade 12/A2 Physics in advance.
 * If you are an A-Level student, you are recommended to take a look at AP/IB textbooks, or textbooks from other examination authorities(EdExcel/CAIE/AQA).
 * Attempt all available PAT, ENGAA, Physics and Maths part of NSAA past papers. Please attempt the past papers under timed condition.
 * If you have time, try to use my `Recommended Learning Resources` to improve your problem solving skills.

## Additional Learning Resources
I have used these resources during my preparation for PAT and interview, I found these are useful. Happy learning and good luck!
